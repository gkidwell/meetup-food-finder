180299272,Cinco de Mayo Margaritas!,http://www.meetup.com/Awesome-Fun-Young-Girlfriends/events/180299272/,"Hey ladies! It looks like we've got a good group going for Saturday. However, we still need to decide on a place and time! I initially scheduled the event for 7:30 PM, but some girls said they would prefer if we get started earlier.

I listed possible places below in the comments section, as well as asking everyone what time they prefer (we'll have to go with the majority on both time and place). If everyone who has RSVP'd could PLEASE comment below and let us know their preferences, that would be awesome!

I'll be choosing a time and place tomorrow and posting the details, so I want to be sure that I pick what everyone is comfortable with. Thanks ladies!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Hey all! I wanted to see if there is any interest in doing some celebrating for Cinco de Mayo this weekend! Monday is actually Cinco de Mayo, but seeing as it's probably best for me not to drink margaritas at work, I figured having an early celebration is the way to go!

There are a few places I know of in the Boston area that serve great Mexican food and margaritas, but I am definitely open to suggestions. Depending on who wants to join, we can all decide on a place!

I know of Papagayo, which has two locations (one near Park Street and the other in Fort Point), and there is also The Painted Burro in Davis Square. But, as I said, other suggestions are welcome!

I know it's almost last minute, but hopefully we can get a group of awesome ladies together to have some yummy food and margaritas!",upcoming
180084022,Boston In Bloom: Creative Flower Photos for Avid Amateurs,http://www.meetup.com/TakeBetterPictures/events/180084022/,"Nobody sees a flower - really - it is so small it takes time - we haven't time - and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time. Georgia O'Keeffe

Flowers and blossoms are among the most popular subjects for photographers. I imagine you have already taken hundreds of GOOD flower photos. We love their colors, shapes, textures and energy.

And with a little more creativity, you can take GREAT photos of flowers. What is the difference? When you show someone a good photo of a flower they say, oh that's nice. When you show them a great photo, they are touched, moved and inspired by the beauty of the image you have created. In this class you will discover how to really see and capture beauty in bloom. Have you ever taken a photo of a flower you thought would be great, only to discover it was boring?

Have you ever wondered how to capture the personality of a flower? Are your photos of flowers all starting to look the same? Or perhaps you think flower photos are ""cliche"" but you are open to seeing them with a fresh eye?
Then this workshop is for you! Flowers are a special subject for photography because they can tell a story, evoke an emotion and invite us to express our creativity. You don't have to be an artist to see like one. In this class I will reveal the simple but effective ways you can see more creatively and express your love of flowers through your photos. In the fun and informative class you will discover: How to capture the translucent, ephemeral quality of a flower

How to compose the shot for the greatest impact and drama

How to use color, texture and shape to express the beauty of blossoms

The class size will be small so you will also receive individual attention and critique so you can immediately improve the quality of your photos. Any type of camera is fine, even your iPhone will work. This is an intuitive approach to creative seeing, not a technical workshop.

I will guide you step by step through a simple process of seeing creatively that you can use from now on not only when you photography flowers, but other subjects as well.

Why not make this the Spring your flower photos go from good to GREAT! If this sounds exciting to you, please RSVP RIGHT NOW. I offer a 100% learning guarantee. If you don't discover something inspiring and practical in this class, I will refund your tuition.

The best part is, you will be learning with other Avid Amateurs who share your love of photography and flowers. We will be meeting at the Charles River where the light is beautiful and the trees are in bloom. Details for exactly where will be provided once you RSVP.

Come join us and take time to see a flower and make a friend. RSVP now please so I can reserve your space in this special class.Tuition $20.00

See you on Saturday! Suzanne

P.S. Plan to stay at the end of class for the social time when we take a look at photos you have taken and have ""refreshments"". Theblossoms won't last for long so catch the beauty while you can.

180019032,Great Meadows walk,http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Walking/events/180019032/,"Please carpool as parking is limited.

Great Meadowsis located just 20 miles west of Boston. The refuge was established in 1947 to provide nesting, resting, and feeding habitat for migratory birds. Roughly 85 percent of the refuge's 3,600 acres is comprised of valuable freshwater wetlands stretching along 12 miles of the Concord and Sudbury Rivers. Well known for its birdwatching opportunities, the public can also enjoy a variety of other wildlife-dependent recreational activities while visiting the refuge.

The Concord Unit is over 250 acres of land abutting the Concord River. It consists of two large pools of water surrounded be woodlands. This combination makes it an attractive stopping place for many different types of migratory birds and summer residents. These pools are usually called impoundments because the water level is adjusted throughout the year by refuge managers to create conditions favorable for diverse wildlife.

The draining of each pool is variably timed to benefit different groups of migrating birds. One pool is drained earlier in the season to encourage the growth of native forage plants that benefit fall-migrating waterfowl. The other pool is drained later in the summer to expose the invertebrate-rich mud flats that provide food for wading birds such as herons and egrets. Both pools are flooded in the fall and remain inundated until the following spring and summer.",upcoming

I (Lisa) will have some hooks available, and Amarley will have some yarn, but if you already have tools on hand or would like to bring your own, a basic guideline is to check your yarns label and whatever size hook it recommends, bring a hook 1-3 sizes smaller. I recommend learning on WORSTED WEIGHT yarn, with a size F, G or H hook. I will also look up a few basic patterns. Knitters* (please see note at the end) should bring their own needles as I wont have extra to give out, though you can certainly look at my collection to see some of the options available out there.

Materials Recommendations

The cheapest and most ubiquitous of the worsted weight yarns is RED HEART SUPER SAVER. It comes in 1 BILLION colors and is found at all major craft stores, Wal-Mart, many independent craft stores and some 5 and 10s. I also recommend (available in major craft stores) Vannas Choice, Lion Brand Wool Ease (contains some wool), or even Patons Classic wool for those not afraid of hand washing. I do not recommend Caron Simply Soft or Red Heart Soft for new crocheters or knitters due to their loosely spun, kind of limp texture, but if you like it, bring it! You are not limited by my recommendations, of course. I also suggest new toy makers not use very thin (or very thick) yarns when learning basic technique. Also, it is easier to learn with LIGHT COLORED yarn. Black can be HARD, even for experienced crafters.

Location

I live in Belmont, MA. My full address will be disclosed prior to the meet-up. I am located a few blocks off of the 73 busline (frequent, terminates in Harvard square Cambridge) and not much farther from the 71 and 75 buslines (also terminate in Harvard square) and have plenty of on-street parking near my house. New people are welcome, so please dont be limited by the fact that this is a private residence.

Preferred Guest Limit  15 . The bigger the group, the less 1 on 1 time I will have for teaching, but I will do my best. Also I will run out of chairs.

Food

Please bring snacks/drinks if you like. I'm not planning on providing food, but there is takeout nearby if people wish to order in.

New Knitters

Knitting toys is more complicated than crocheting them (in my opinion) due to the tools and techniques involved. One crochet hook in a size can do it all, but different needles are required in knitting for different tasks. For round objects, you cant use those long, straight needles in the craft store. You need Double Pointed Needles (DPNs) or Long circular needles (two needles connected by a flexible cord) for knitting in the round. While I can definitely give you pointers, teaching how to use these types of needles for brand new knitters can be intense, and getting started can be fiddly, even for experienced knitters. If there are enough people that want to learn to knit, we may be able to make a separate day for teaching these techniques.",upcoming
